            <h1>Current Politics</h1>
            <p>After the 2016 election, the next president was Rodrigo Duterte. He promised a fierce anti-drug campaign that made many people back his side. The truth was sadder than the promises though. With that "War On Drugs", many people have died. The current government under him is also filled with even more corruption than the previous few governments. Another is a few deals favoring the Chinese government over maritime territory. An overall not too great time for the Filipinos.</p>
